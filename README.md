### Abstract
Accessibility in visualization is an important yet challenging topic. Sonification, in particular, is a valuable yet underutilized technique that can enhance accessibility for people with vision deficiencies. However, auditory information is presented sequentially, and for this reason, interactivity is key in making full use of its potential. In this thesis, we present a novel approach to visualization accessibility that utilizes a sonified interactive lens in the context of dense line charts. This approach takes advantage of the inherent directions of lines for sonification and dynamically scales amplitude for improved density perception. Combined, this produces a visualization that not only uses sonification as an additional information channel but also as a complementary element. Finally, we discuss the potential of our contribution based on a set of case studies.
